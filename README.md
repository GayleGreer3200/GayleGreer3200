## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to this repository â€” a personal collection of projects, experiments, and learning resources centered around shaders and visual effects in Unity. As a game developer diving deeper into the world of real-time rendering, this space reflects a hands-on journey into the creative and technical aspects of building immersive visuals.

The focus here is on learning and implementing shaders using Unityâ€™s ShaderLab, HLSL, and the Universal Render Pipeline (URP), as well as experimenting with VFX Graph, particle systems, and screen-space effects. These projects range from simple surface shaders and lighting models to more advanced effects like procedural textures, water, dissolve transitions, and post-processing.

Each project is designed not only to practice core shader concepts, but also to explore how visuals can enhance gameplay, storytelling, and player experience. Alongside code, youâ€™ll find scene setups, materials, and clear documentation aimed at making each effect easy to understand and reuse. The goal is to build a solid foundation while sharing progress openly and inviting feedback from the community.

This repository is a work in progress, constantly evolving as new techniques are learned and applied. Whether you're a fellow developer exploring Unityâ€™s rendering stack, or just curious about what goes into crafting visual magic behind the scenes, feel free to look around, fork a project, or drop a suggestion.

Feedback and collaboration are always welcome â€” this journey is just getting started, and there's plenty more to discover. Thanks for stopping by, and enjoy experimenting with the visual side of Unity!
